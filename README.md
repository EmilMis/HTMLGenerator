# HTMLGenerator
Python "library" for generating HTML code, unfinished


As of now, you can add images, center them, or put them on the right or left. Similarly, you can't do much with text apart from set font face and font size and some other stuff, and using tables is not much more customizable either, so I will finish this project later on.

Bye and I hope you like the cat images!
